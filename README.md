# Energy Markets: Does Employee Satisfaction Help Explain Excess Returns?

## Overview
This repository contains a structured analytical report examining whether employee satisfaction ratings help explain excess returns in the energy sector. The project emphasizes translating data into insights rather than software development.

The final deliverable is provided as a standalone HTML report for ease of review.

## Objective
To apply analytical methods to real-world data and communicate findings in a clear, logically structured format suitable for decision-making and interpretation.

## Methodology
- Web scraping and data cleaning
- Exploratory and descriptive analysis
- Quantitative reasoning and interpretation
- Synthesis of findings into a cohesive report

## Tools & Technologies
- Data analysis and reporting tools (R, Quarto)
- JS script for web scraping
- HTML for final report rendering

## Repository Contents
- `nolan-enzo-will.html` — Final analytical report including methodology, results, visualizations, and conclusions
- `nolan-enzo-will.qmd` — Quarto document containing the code
- `glassdoor_reviews_backup.rds` — Backup containing a full set of reviews (as running the web scraper takes a long time)

## Skills Demonstrated
- Analytical thinking and problem structuring
- Data interpretation and quantitative reasoning
- Clear communication of technical findings
